# Human_Activity_Recognition_MSC_Project by Padmavathi Palakala MSc Information Systems

Dataset from UCIMachine learning Repository

Features are related to Classification Model

Steps involved

1.Load the Data 
2.Importing the Libraries
3.Exploratory Data Analysis
4.Visualise the heatmap for the features
5.Smoothing the data 
6.check whether each range values of features are equally distributed
7.read test data also
8. model building using different classification algorithms
9.Accuracy optained with classifiers
